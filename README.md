# Re:Co Insights Technical Test

This test involves creating a simple CRUD application that displays a list of surveys fetched from the backend API. However, the application is missing some functionalities, such as the ability to `create a new survey` and `delete an existing survey`.

### TODO

- You need to implement the functionality to edit an existing survey.
- Tip: Don't focus on formatting, prettifying the syntax, or making it perfect. The priority for this test is building something functional.

### Tech Stack

- Programming Language: `TypeScript` for both backend and front-end
- Front-End: React (Next.js)
- Back-End: Serverless Stack (SST) with Lambda functions
- Database: MongoDB (as a Docker container)

### Running the Project Locally

- To start the backend:
  - Run `npm run be:start` (keep this terminal open)
- Open another terminal window and run:
  - `npm run fe:start`
- The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`
- Best of luck!
